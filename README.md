# DeepCAR

DeepCAR extends the vanilla [DeepAR method] by incorporating change points. 
It is described in the Paper: [The DeepCAR Method: Forecasting Time-Series Data That Have Change Points]. This repository provides some implementations.

# Simulations

In Simulation_Football_Data.ipynb we give an example with our DeepCAR method using a [football dataset]. And in Mosum_Football_Data.ipynb you can find the [MOSUM method] that was applied to this football dataset and provides the change points for our method.
